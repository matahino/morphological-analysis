"So, I asked a Japanese person one day. Why does the phrase 'ame ni furareru' (to be rained on) feel natural, but 'saifu ga ochirareru' (to be dropped a wallet) sounds incorrect? The Japanese person replied, 'Well, a wallet is like a part of your body, isn't it? Have you ever had a part of your body dropped?' Right then and there, my wallet fell. That's why I created this software to analyze such intriguing aspects of the Japanese language."
